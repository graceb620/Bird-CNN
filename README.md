# Bird-CNN
A convolutional neural network created to correctly categorize different bird species

## The goal  
Compare the results from three different CNN running on two different algorithms using accuracy, average loss, and confusion matrices.  

## The Networks
1. AlexNet
2. VGGNet
3. ResNet

## The Algorithms
1. SGD
2. Adam

## The Documents
* The data is located in the data/bird_species_v1 folder
  * test folder contains the data used in the testing
  * train folder contains the data used to train the algorithms
* Bero_Project2.ipynb is the Google Collab Notebook used to conduct the experiment
